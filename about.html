                About Me
            </h2>
            <p>
                Hello! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Tobias Mellum Jondahl, and I come from Arna,
                just outside Bergen, Norway. I'm currently in the final stretch of completing my Bachelor's
                degree in Information Science at the University of Bergen.
            </p>
            <p>
                From a young age, I've been fascinated by technology and how it shapes the way we live,
                work, and interact. This interest has led me to explore coding, systems development,
                and digital solutions. Through my studies, I've developed skills in HTML, CSS, Python, SQL,
                and gained a solid understanding of system design, algorithms,
                and the foundations of information systems.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I'm not busy solving problems with code or learning new technologies,
                I enjoy spending time exploring Bergen's stunning landscapes and rich history.
                Growing up near the coast has instilled in me an appreciation for both nature
                and the balance that technology can bring to our lives.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm now excited to transition into the professional world where I can combine my passion for innovation
                and my skills to contribute to building the digital solutions of tomorrow.
                Whether it's front-end development, back-end work, or designing systems,
                I'm eager to collaborate and grow as part of a dynamic team.
                <br>
                If youâ€™d like to connect or learn more about my projects and experiences, donâ€™t hesitate to reach out!
